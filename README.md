## Overview

This repository contains a series of practical exercises and projects focused on Big Data Analytics. The practicals aim to provide hands-on experience with various big data tools and techniques, enabling users to analyze and derive insights from large datasets effectively.

## Features

- **Hands-On Exercises**: A variety of practicals covering different aspects of big data analytics.
- **Sample Datasets**: Real-world datasets for analysis and experimentation.
- **Step-by-Step Guides**: Detailed instructions for each practical.
- **Tool Integration**: Work with popular big data technologies like Hadoop, Spark, and SQL.
- **Data Visualization**: Techniques for visualizing big data insights.

## Technologies Used

- Apache Hadoop
- Apache Spark
- Apache Hive
- Apache Pig
- Python
- SQL
- Jupyter Notebook (for interactive coding)

## Installation

To set up your environment, you will need to install the following:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Required for Hadoop and Spark.
2. **Apache Hadoop**: Download and install from the [Hadoop official website](https://hadoop.apache.org/).
3. **Apache Spark**: Download and install from the [Spark official website](https://spark.apache.org/).
4. **Jupyter Notebook**: Install via pip:
